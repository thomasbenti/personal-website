          <p>
            I'm Thomas Bentivoglio, a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science double major at Case Western Reserve University.
            I focus on robotics, embedded systems, and full-stack software development. Iâ€™m currently working on cable-driven hyper-redundant robots,
            integrating Onshape CAD with ROS2 and MuJoCo simulation for real-time control research.
